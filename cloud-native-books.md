Similar to [[1.project-ideas.cloud-native-logos]] but with info about books instead of logos. In particular, also very similar to [[1.project-ideas.book-gallery-website]] (essentially the same but without remote storage of the actual books and download and upload functionality).

The collection of books has been started on https://github.com/weibeld/cloud-native-books

> Additional information relevant for this project can be found in [[1.project-ideas.cloud-native-logos]] and [[1.project-ideas.book-gallery-website]]. This project idea note only contains the information that is different from these two projects.

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide an overview of books that are relavant to the cloud-native computing space.

The main difference to [[1.project-ideas.book-gallery-website]] is that no PDF files are actually stored anywhere. The website only displays textual information about a book and ideally a picture of the book cover.

Instead of PDF files, a picture of the book cover must thus be maintained for every book.

### Open questions

1. Should tags be used (see [[1.project-ideas.cloud-native-logos]] and [[1.project-ideas.book-gallery-website]])?
    - In general, tags are probably easier to implement for books than for projects. However, if the books are restricted to cloud-native topics, it might be equally difficult.
2. Should descriptions be added to the books (similar as in [[1.project-ideas.cloud-native-projects]])?
