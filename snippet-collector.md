  title: Snippet Collector
---

## Description

A web application that allows easily collecting code snippets.

The idea is to quickly paste code snippets there that can then be easily copied to the clipboard through e.g. a button.

Example snippets:

> Query the source file path of a man page:
> 
> ```bash
> man --path <name>
> ```

> Set the terminal emulation type in iTerm2:
> 
> ```
> Preferences > Profile > Terminal > Report terminal type
> ```
> 
> > Notes: this defines which "physical" terminal iTerm2 emulates.
