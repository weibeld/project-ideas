A tool that allows easy and interactive unsetting of kubeconfig entries.

## Description

Display a unified view of all the kubeconfig entries in fzf and allow selecting multiple ones for deletion.

## Background

- This could be in a similar light as [kubectl-ctx](https://github.com/weibeld/kubectl-ctx) and [kubectl-ns](https://github.com/weibeld/kubectl-ns) or the `klc`, `kcc`, etc. aliase
- It could probably even be distributed together with the above kubectl plugins/alases
