Displaying man pages in a way that is easier to consume.

## Problem

Man pages (especially long ones) are hard to process, e.g. understanding the hierarchy of sections, etc.

## Solution

Output a man page in a format that is easier to process, e.g. with collapsible sections.

The output could be:

- HTML
- Text that can be processed with Vim (e.g. collapsing sections)
